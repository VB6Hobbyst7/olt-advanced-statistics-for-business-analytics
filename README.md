# Resources for "Advanced Excel Statistics for Business Analytics," O'Reilly Media

Inferential statistics involves inferring parameters of a population based on the values of a sample. These tests form the basis of building predictive models and simulations. Join expert George Mount for a hands-on approach to conducting advanced statistical inference using Microsoft Excel. By the end of this course, users will be able to forecast and make predictions about their data, using inferential statistics for business impact.
